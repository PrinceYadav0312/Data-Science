🏏 IPL 2024 Data Visualization Project

A complete hands-on project where I applied all my learned concepts to visualize IPL 2024 cricket data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy.

🔍 Key Insights:

- Top run scorers and wicket takers

- Team performance comparisons

- Strike rate and economy rate visualization

- Correlation analysis using heatmaps and regression plots

📘 Learning Highlights

- Mastered core Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization

- Built confidence in data storytelling using plots

- Gained understanding of statistical concepts like:

  - Mean, Median, Mode

  - Variance & Standard Deviation
  
  - IQR, Skewness, Kurtosis
  
  - One-way & Two-way data, Ogives, and Joint Distribution

🔮 Future Roadmap

🚧 Currently expanding this repository with:

- 📊 More advanced Statistics & Probability topics

- 🤖 Hands-on AI/ML projects

- 📈 Real-world EDA and predictive analytics projects

💡 My Goal

To become a Data Analyst → Data Scientist → AI/ML Engineer,
and this repository represents every step of that journey.
